Telangana is one of the fastest-growing states in India and one of the states with an open data policy. (They have published all their data online)


Peter Pandey is an aspiring data analyst looking for a project with real-time data to add to his portfolio. He wanted to analyse Telanganaâ€™s growth among different sectors quantitatively and provide useful Insights to the Telangana government that would help them to make data-informed decisions that would further support the growth of the state.

Peter Pandey began this project by drafting some of the key objectives for this analysis.

Imagining myself as Peter Pandey, I will answer the following question with the data I have:


 Stamp Registration 
 1. How does the revenue generated from document registration vary across districts in Telangana? List down the top 5 districts that showed the highest document registration revenue growth between FY 2019 and 2022

2. How does the revenue generated from document registration compare to the revenue generated from e-stamp challans across districts? List down the top 5 districts where e-stamps revenue contributes significantly more to the revenue than the documents in FY 2022? 

3. Is there any alteration of e-Stamp challan count and document registration count pattern since the implementation of e-Stamp challan? If so, what suggestions would you propose to the 
government? 

4. Categorize districts into three segments based on their stamp registration revenue generation during the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.

 Transportation 

5. Investigate whether there is any correlation between vehicle sales and specific months or seasons in different districts. Are there any months or seasons that consistently show higher or lower sales rate, and if yes, what could be the driving factors? (Consider Fuel-Type category only) 

6. How does the distribution of vehicles vary by vehicle class (MotorCycle, MotorCar, AutoRickshaw, Agriculture) across different districts? Are there any districts with a predominant preference for a specific vehicle class? Consider FY 2022 for analysis. 

7. List down the top 3 and bottom 3 districts that have shown the highest and lowest vehicle sales growth during FY 2022 compared to FY 2021? (Consider and compare categories: Petrol, Diesel and Electric) Ts-Ipass (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self Certification System) 

8. List down the top 5 sectors that have witnessed the most significant investments in FY 2022. 

9. List down the top 3 districts that have attracted the most significant sector investments during FY 2019 to 2022? What factors could have led to the substantial investments in these particular districts? 

10. Is there any relationship between district investments, vehicles sales and stamp revenue within the same district between FY 2021 and 2022? 

11. Are there any particular sectors that have shown substantial investment in multiple districts between FY 2021 and 2022? 

12. Can we identify any seasonal patterns or cyclicality in the investment trends for specific sectors? Do certain sectors experience higher investments during particular months? codebasics.io 

Secondary Research: (Need additional research and get additional data) Note: These are just examples, you can add more questions 

1. What are the top 5 districts to buy commercial properties in Telangana? Justify your answer. 

2. What significant policies or initiatives were put into effect to enhance economic growth, investments, and employment in Telangana by the current government? Can we quantify the impact of these policies using available data? 

3. Provide top 5 Insights & 5 recommendations to Telangana government for sustained growth in the next 5 years based on your analysis
